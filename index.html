        We live in a world saturated with sound—videos, podcasts, streaming—but much of our listening happens passively, in the background, and we often fail to notice how it shapes our daily life. Immersive, attentive listening is increasingly rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phonographic Dogma interrogates musical listening practices and extends this inquiry to everyday contexts: the sounds of cities, the spaces we inhabit, and the environments we frequent. Listening becomes a way to train attention, to recognize, classify, and hierarchize relationships, noticing both form and emotional impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phonographic Dogma is not anti-digital—it reflects on listening itself, emphasizing the importance of focused, deliberate engagement in an age of constant auditory abundance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this first act, Phonographic Dogma proposes experiences based on long durations, often at pianissimo dynamic levels, encouraging careful, sustained attention.
This selection requires a posture of attentiveness: extended durations, subtle thresholds, listening without distraction. It offers no immediate reward; it challenges listeners to maintain focus and sharpen perceptual awareness.
