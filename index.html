        We live in an era where the digital makes music instantly accessible, yet weakens the quality of listening: fragmented, disembodied, without space. It is not the music that has changed — it is the way we encounter it. Circulation has expanded, but the relationship has thinned out.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the digital domain, sound loses its body and its place: no resonant environment, no physical trace of instruments or rooms. Listening risks becoming a scroll, a quick consumption, a permanent background.
      </p>
      <p>
        This selection proposes a different posture: extended durations, subtle thresholds, attentive slowness. It offers no immediate grasp and seeks no easy reward; it invites presence. Listening becomes an exercise in perception, a training of attention, a way to reconnect with the complexity of the real.
