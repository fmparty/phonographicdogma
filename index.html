        Phonographic Dogma is devoted to investigating listening practices in music and the sonic arts. 
Phonographic Dogma invites audiences to embrace live listening whenever possible. Against the tide of algorithmic brevity, it advocates for sustained immersion in long-form musical experiences, urging listeners to focus exclusively on sound, without distraction. In doing so, it resists the reduction of music to ambient noise or fleeting background stimulus.
Phonographic Dogma champions the attentive exploration of complex sonic forms—engaging with detail, relationships between musical or sonic elements, and the structural and emotional intricacies embedded within the artwork. It is an invitation to approach the world’s complexity not with avoidance or haste, but with rigor, analysis, and critique. Listening becomes an act of intellectual and perceptual engagement—a way to cultivate discernment, deepen awareness, and foster resilience against the noise of superficial abundance.
In an auditory landscape characterized by immediacy, Phonographic Dogma insists on patience, presence, and a commitment to critical inquiry—reclaiming listening as an art, a discipline, and a pathway to critical understanding.

        Phonographic Dogma is not anti-digital—it reflects on listening practices itself, emphasizing the importance of focused, deliberate engagement in an age of constant auditory abundance.

        For this first act, Phonographic Dogma proposes experiences based on long durations, often at pianissimo dynamic levels, encouraging careful, sustained attention.
This selection requires a posture of attentiveness: extended durations, subtle thresholds, listening without distraction.
