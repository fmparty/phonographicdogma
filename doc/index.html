        Phonographic Dogma is dedicated to music, sound art and their contemporary declinations, with a profound attentiveness to the phenomenology of listening.<br>
        This act invites you to enter the space of quiet — not as mere absence of noise, but as an attentive openness to sound, time and presence.<br>
        By activating this tag, you perform an intervention: a small gesture which initiates the act of listening.<br>
        The music offered here pursues the gentle edge of audibility — moments where sound becomes threshold, atmosphere, texture.<br>
        Here, listening is not passive, but a discipline: an act of care toward the sonic environment, toward oneself, toward others.<br><br>
        <strong>Headphone listening is recommended.</strong>
