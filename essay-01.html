      <p>Streaming services have demystified individual acts of listening to recorded music because platforms like Spotify render all listening as a data-generating activity; every signal listening experience informs an algorithm that works towards building a listener profile (Prey, 2016: 41). Streaming platforms bring about a ‘datafication of listening’; music itself becomes a tracking device which—combined with demographic information – is reflected back onto users in the form of ads (Prey, 2018: 1094). Users of these services produce an array of digital traces that they make as they go about their everyday lives (Drott 2018; Prey, 2016: 43). But as Prey (2019: 18) observes it remains an open question as to whether – or to what degree – this knowledge about the state of perpetual monitoring occurring on streaming services might affect listening behaviour itself.

      <p>What is it to listen phenomenologically? It is more than an intense and concentrated attention to sound and listening, it is also to be aware in the process of the pervasiveness of certain “beliefs” that intrude into my attempt to listen “to the things themselves.”

      <p>To listen to recorded music however, may entail a certain blindness to this process. The production of the recorded music lies behind and is presupposed by the end result. The studio is a complex location and process here involved. Acoustical space is constructed; takes, retakes, and increasing musical editing goes into the development of the record such that a simple live-performance recording becomes but one possibility out of many. Active “construction“ is the norm. The editing process “picks and chooses” the best takes (the analogue with cinema is obvious) to produce the “best” result. Time forward and the age of the “remix.”
